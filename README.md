## Note:
Waka is a community resource that tracks the approximate value of NC items, based on real-world trades.

The Waka Team aims to maintain the accuracy of the guide as fully as possible, but please remember values are often changing and with certain difficult-to-find or popular items it doesn't hurt to make a value check!
